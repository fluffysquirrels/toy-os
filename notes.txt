Registers
r0-r1 (arguments, scratch, return values)
r2-r3 (arguments, scratch)
r4-r10
r11 aka fp (frame pointer, prev stack frame?)
r12 aka ip (intra-procedure-call scratch register)
r13 aka sp (stack pointer)
r14 aka lr (link register, call return address)
r15 aka pc (program counter)

In supervisor mode all registers are as user mode except for r13 (sp), r14 (lr). SPSR is available, reflects CPSR before switching to supervisor mode.
In system mode SPSR is not available, all variables are the same as in user mode, CPSR is writable.
