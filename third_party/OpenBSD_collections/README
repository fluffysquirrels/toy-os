        _null.h,
        queue.h,
        tree.h,
}

I made a small #include path change to {queue,tree}.h. The unmodified version is in *.h.orig.

tree's documentation is in a man page at http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man3/tree.3 with a local copy saved in this directory.

queue's documentation in in a man page at http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man3/queue.3 with a local copy saved in this directory.
