** User mode thread_t.cpsr ends up 0x60000010 = irq, why?

* Features:
** some syscall that reads arguments
** some syscall that returns a value
** User mode can wait for timers.
** User mode can read from / write to console in a pre-emptible way.
** fork
** Jump to interrupt handler selected from a configured array of them

* Nice features:
