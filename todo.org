* Bugs
** User mode thread_t.cpsr ends up 0x60000010 = irq, why?

* Features:
** some syscall that reads arguments
** some syscall that returns a value
** User mode can wait for timers.
** User mode can read from / write to console in a preemptible way.
** fork
** Jump to interrupt handler from a configured array of them

* Nice features:
** Memory protection
*** Stack overflow detection
*** User-mode lockdown
** Dynamic allocation
** IPC
** Network I/O
** Disk I/O

* Nice:
** Extract synchronous logging to a new .c file
** Extract UNUSED and memset to a util file
** Use macro constants to refer to processor modes
** Tests
** Generate .h file with #define THREAD_OFFSET_* calculated with offsetof
** Assert register contents in the busy loop of second()
